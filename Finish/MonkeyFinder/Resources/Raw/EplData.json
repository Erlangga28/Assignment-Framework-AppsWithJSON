This has led to claims by the club that Crystal Palace should be recognised as the oldest professional football club in the world,[1] after historians discovered a lineage through the Crystal Palace Company. Both the amateur and professional clubs played inside the grounds of the palace, with the professional club using the FA Cup Final stadium for its home games until 1915, when they were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the First World War. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.",
